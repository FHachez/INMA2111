From Prof Delvelnne:

"Regarding notes: as suggested, I offer 0.5 bonus point on the final grade for half a course written in LaTeX. So pair up for a full 2-hour course."

"Dear students,

in our effort to write notes for the course, it would be nice that you all share a common LaTeX template so as to assemble the final document easily.

One possible way is the following: the first group to finish (as far as I know that would be Dounia+Cyril) could share their document or template, and the others would use it. Of course i let you free to organize this differently."
