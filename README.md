From Prof Delvenne:

"Regarding notes: as suggested, I offer 0.5 bonus point on the final grade for half a course written in LaTeX. So pair up for a full 2-hour course."

"Dear students,

in our effort to write notes for the course, it would be nice that you all share a common LaTeX template so as to assemble the final document easily.

One possible way is the following: the first group to finish (as far as I know that would be Dounia+Cyril) could share their document or template, and the others would use it. Of course i let you free to organize this differently."

"For collaborative notes writing, Nicolas Boutet (nicolas.boutet@student.uclouvain.be) kindly proposed to coordinate all the courses into one final document, so let him know if you participate. 

In the event there are not 12 teams for the 12 courses, I see no problem in teams covering a second course (doubling up the bonus point: in this event each member of the team would gain one bonus point, for the entire 2-course effort)."
